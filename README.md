# GloVe Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Dataset

## Project Overview
This project utilizes the GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) model for sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. The primary objective is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, leveraging GloVe embeddings to improve the accuracy of our sentiment analysis model. The project encompasses data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the IMDB dataset for analysis, including text normalization, tokenization, and converting text data into sequences.
- **GloVe Embeddings:** Using pre-trained GloVe vectors to transform words into meaningful numerical representations.
- **Model Architecture:** Building and training neural network models (e.g., LSTM, CNN) that utilize GloVe embeddings for sentiment classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment:** Providing scripts and tools for deploying the trained model for real-world sentiment analysis applications.
